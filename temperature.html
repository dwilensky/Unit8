<!-- 3b. Can you think of a functional difference between the two button creating elements?
	Answer: for aesthetic reasons, one might chose to stay with the traditional 'input type = "button"' 
	element, especially if coding a block of various input types. A critical reason not to use this element
	is that it is treated differently by different browsers: some versions of IE submit the text between the <button>, 
	</button> tags, while other browsers will submit the content of the value attribute.
